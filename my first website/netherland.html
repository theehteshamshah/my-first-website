    <h1>Netherland</h1>

    <p>Paragraph: The Netherlands is also informally referred to as Holland in various languages, including English, and was used by the Dutch government to promote their country. However in 2019, the Dutch government announced that it would only communicate and advertise under its real name "the Netherlands" in the future, and stop describing itself as Holland. They stated: “It has been agreed that the Netherlands, the official name of our country, should preferably be used.”[15][45] From 2019 onwards, the nation’s football team will solely be called the Netherlands in any official setting.[15] Nonetheless, the name "Holland" is still widely used for the Netherlands national football team and the international website for tourism is still named "holland.com</p>
